# Genetic-Algorithm-with-Geatpy
This project uses the Geatpy library to realize the glass production process scheduling model based on genetic algorithm. 
This code is designed by Huang Jiaqi and will be submitted as the program part of the course design.


I would like to thank Wang Jiyang and Dong Wei for their contributions to this project. Thank you!
